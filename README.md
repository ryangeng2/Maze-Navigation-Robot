Components:
(1) L298N Motor Driver
(2) 200 RPM TT Motor
(1) 5V DC-DC Buck Converter
(1) Raspberry Pi Pico
(1) Ping Pong Ball
(3) HC-R04 Ultrasonic Sensors
(1) 9V Battery Pack
(1) Breadboard
(1) I2C LCD Display

To navigate, it uses a Pathfinding Algorithm that adjusts motor speed to stay in the center and then takes the longest path when it approaches a wall in front. Code can be found in this repository.
